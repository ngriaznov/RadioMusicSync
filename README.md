This is not a radio. It is a sample player that behaves like a radio.  

A digital way to simulate radio-powered compositions by John Cage, Karlheinz Stockhausen and Don Buchla's voltage-controlled radio experiments. It uses a teensy3.1 to play files from a SD card to simulate a voltage controlled AM/FM/Shortwave/Time Travel radio. 

####Progress
