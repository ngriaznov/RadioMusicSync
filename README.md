![Image from matcsat, Muffwiggler forum](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TomWhitwell/RadioMusic/master/Collateral/BuildImages/rmpic.jpg)

Based on the [original firmware](https://gitter.im/TomWhitwell/RadioMusic) by Tom Whitwell

Allows to play files synchronously with clock.

Usage:
- put 16-th trigger stream into the station input
- set BPM parameter to your desired base tempo in settings.txt on the SD card (default 130)
- upload audio files with tempo set to desired tempo (the one you set in settings.txt)

WARNING: this is an alpha version, so please download the original firmware beforehand. There are more things to implement, so please be patient.
